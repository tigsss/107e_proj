Project Name: LED Retrofitted Vintage Boombox

Team members
Alex Lee
Tiger Sun

Description
The primary goal of this project is to use the RPi to play music through a refitted vintage radio case with LED visualization. We hope to store the music on a USB/external storage device that we can connect to the Pi. The Pi will extract the music from the USB device and play it through the speakers inside a refitted vintage radio case by converting the music files (i.e. MP3 or WAV) into readable files. The LED visualization portion will be based on the music that is playing and adapt the colors and beats to whatever song is playing at the moment. We are hoping to use what we learned in creating the Larson Scanner and apply it to this project while using a single strip LED visualizer. The following link has a good demonstration of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNtM7jH5GXg. In a sentence, we will be creating a vintage speaker that can play whatever song is stored on a USB device and has LED visualization effects in accordance with the songs.
